This efficiency gain is achieved through TNG's \"Assembly-of-Experts\" (AoE) method, which merges weight tensors from multiple pre-trained models. The MIT-licensed model is available on Hugging Face and is highly praised by the AI developer community for its potential to lower inference costs and speed up responses in enterprise applications.\n",
